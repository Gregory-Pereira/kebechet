      <description>Three easy steps I will help you to create new releases of your own source code and I will also help you with keeping the depencencies of your source code up to date. Enabling me to work on your source code is easy. It requires hub, which I strongly recommend! As you are a developer yourself, you know the steps by heart:

      <description>Kebechet  I&amp;rsquo;m Kebechet, goddess of freshness. I will keep your sources and dependencies fresh and up-to-date.
 Kebechet is a SourceOps bot that automates updating dependencies of your project. Currently, it supports managing and updating Python projects based on pipenv files (Pipfile and Pipfile.lock) or requirements.txt/requirements.in files (see pip-tools) - Kebechet is a replacement for it.
Configuration of Kebechet Kebechet is configured using a simple YAML configuration file. Check the documentation of managers to get all the available options.</description>
